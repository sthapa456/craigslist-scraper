            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Yelp connects people to great local businesses, but who connects search queries to 100+ million reviews on millions of businesses in under 400 milliseconds?  Who can select the perfect ad from millions of possibilities before the user can blink an eye? And after that user has found the perfect restaurant and is happily munching on their quinoa salad, who makes sure our logs are transported, transformed, and indexed so that we can do even better for them next time? We do: the data backend engineers who make these systems work fast, efficiently, and at scale.<br><br>We’re looking for experienced engineers to join our team to build elegant, scalable systems that use NoSQL data stores, data warehouses, map-reduce and streaming solutions to power a whole host of personalized experiences for Yelp’s users and drive optimizations for Yelp’s advertising businesses.  If you’re the person who lead their team in replacing an aging system, or dives fearlessly into the guts of a running system to fix that bug everyone else is happy to gloss over, then we’re looking for you!<br><br>Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity, and encourages “unboring” solutions to problems. New hires are expected to deploy working code their first week -- and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager and mentor. At the end of the day, we are all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.</p>
